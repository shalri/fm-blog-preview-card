## My process

### Built

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Prettier Tailwind Plugin
- ViteJS Tooling

### What I learned

This challenge showed the importance of a `.fig` file. I spent most of the time pixel-pushing to set the dimensions, spacing, and layout just right. I am quite proud of the results since I was just eyeballing it.

Doing this challenge emphasized how Tailwind is such a paradigm shift in my workflow. Figuring out the build process for deploying to Github Pages laid the foundation for fast and efficient development.

I learned how to extend Tailwind using the style guide conveniently provided by Frontendmentor. Working with a style guide really makes the coding process so much easier.

### Continued development

I am looking forward to doing more challenges from [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io). I like learning and practicing new concepts. I will probably start using ReactJS on future challenges.
